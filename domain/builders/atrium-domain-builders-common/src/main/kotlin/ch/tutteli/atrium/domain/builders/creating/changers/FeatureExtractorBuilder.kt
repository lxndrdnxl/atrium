/**
 * Defines the contract for sophisticated `safe feature extractions` including assertion creation for the feature.
 *
 * It is similar to [NewFeatureAssertions] but differs in the intended usage.
 * [NewFeatureAssertions] are intended to make assertions about a return value of a method call or a property,
 * assuming that the call as such always succeeds (no exception is thrown).
 * The [FeatureExtractorBuilder] on the other hand should be used if it is already known,
 * that the call/access fails depending on given arguments.
 * For instance, [List.get] is a good example where it fails if the given index is out of bounds.
